        <p>Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty, however, of locating his
        wife's killer is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of memory loss. Although he can
        recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going,
        or why.</p>

        to protect those closest to him. Still haunted by the events from the Battle of Manhattan, he must confront challenges
        from not only this old adversary but from himself as well, and finally answer a question which has plagued him from the

        <p>"What's the most resilient parasite? A bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? [...] An idea. Resilient, highly
        contagious. Once an idea has taken hold in the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed,

        <p>"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our
        future."
        — Sonmi~451
          <br>The film consists of six nested stories, each set in a different place and era, moving forwards in time from the 19th
        century all the way to the future After the End. Each story and style is a pastiche of the most recognizable examples of
        the genre, and lovingly combines old clichés with new twists. A comet-shaped birthmark appears in each story on the
        protagonist, and the characters reference names, places, and experiences from other stories.

        when we dared to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known — we count these
        moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all of that. Or perhaps, we've just forgotten that we are still
        pioneers, that we've barely begun, and that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us — that our destiny lies
        above us."

        Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these
        people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are
        not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight
